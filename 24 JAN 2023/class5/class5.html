     <!-- External CSS

● When you need to make changes to several pages, you often use the
external style sheet.
● It is perfect in this situation because it enables you to alter just one file to
alter the appearance of the complete website.
● It uses the <link> tag on every page and the <link> tag should be put inside
the head section.

● Example:

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">
</head>

Advantages of External CSS:

● The style of several documents can be controlled from site by using them.
● Multiple HTML elements can have many documents, where classes can be created.
● To group styles in complex situations, selector and grouping methods are used.

Disadvantages of External CSS:

● Extra download is needed to import documents having style information.
● To render the document, the external style sheet should be loaded.
● Not practical for small style definitions. -->
